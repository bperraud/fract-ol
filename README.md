# fract-ol

One of the first graphical projects at 42 school, fract-ol generates beautiful fractals from the complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.
